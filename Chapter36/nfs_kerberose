# first of all you required .keytab file for nfs client and server 

# download and install .keytab files from Kerberoes server 

##
## Configure NFS server with kerberoes authentication
##

# ensure SELinux labels are correct
restorecon -v /etc/krb5.keytab

# check nfs server status on nfs server
systemctl status nfs-server

# make directory on nfs server for sharing
mkdir /share/server

# set SELinux context labels
semanage fcontext -a -t nfs_t "/share/server(/.*)?"

# ensure SELinux labels are correct
restorecon -v /share/server

# make respective user as owner of shared directory
chown USER /share/server

# enable kerberoes method in /etc/exports file
/share/server	*(sec=krb5p,rw)

# export newly created share
exportfs -rv

# verify mount
showmount -e localhost

##
## Configure NFS client with kerberoes authentication
##

# make directory on client to mount server share
mkdir /mnt/client

# mount server share to client directory with sec method
mount -o sec=krb5p NFS_SERVER:/share/server	/mnt/client

# access as owner user
su - USER

# make sure user established kerberos session
kinit USER

# create any file to verify kerberos authentication
